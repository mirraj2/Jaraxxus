          <dt>How do I get matched up with my opponent?</dt>
          <dd>When a round has begun, you will be given your opponent's BattleTag. Add your opponent as a friend
           and challenge them to a duel!</dd>
          <dt>How is the winner reported?</dt>
          <dd>Once you finish a game, you can click a button on the website indicating that you won or lost.</dd>
          <dt>What happens if my opponent doesn't show up?</dt>
          <dd>Check to see if they are in the website chatroom. Try to friend-request their battletag. If nothing works and they show up after 5 minutes, they will forfeit the match.</dd>
          <dt>How are disputes handled?</dt>
          <dd>An admin will look at all available evidence including chat logs and other data in order to come to a decision.</dd>
          <dt>Why is there not a bigger prize?</dt>
          <dd>This money is coming from my own wallet. The point right now is to have fun, not make money.
           If we get sponsors at some point, maybe this will change.</dd>
           <dt>I'm worried about logging in with my Battle.net credential. Is this site secure?</dt>
           <dd>Jaraxxus.com uses OAuth technology to integrate with Battle.net. What this means is that your Battle.net credentials are NEVER sent to jaraxxus.com. The only thing we get is your BattleTag (which is necessary for running the tournament).</dd>
          <dt>Other questions?</dt>
          <dd>Email satnam@jaraxxus.com</dd>
